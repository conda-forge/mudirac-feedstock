  summary: 'Simulation software that integrates the Dirac equation for muonic atoms to compute their X-Ray transition energies.'
  description: |
    MuDirac is a simulation software that integrates the Dirac equation for muonic atoms to compute their X-Ray transition energies;
    it is written in C++.  The use and functioning of MuDirac 1.0 is extensively documented in the paper [S. Sturniolo, A. Hillier, 
    “Mudirac: A Dirac equation solver for elemental analysis with muonic X-rays”, X-Ray Spectrom. 2020;1–17](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/xrs.3212),
    which should be cited by any work using it.
